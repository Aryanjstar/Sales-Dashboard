## 📊 Project Overview

This dashboard provides real-time insights into sales performance, revenue tracking, and customer analytics. I built it to help managers quickly understand sales trends and business performance through intuitive visualizations and data tables.

### Key Features

- **Interactive KPI Cards**: Real-time metrics with dynamic color coding
- **Advanced Charts**: Line charts for trends, pie charts for distribution
- **Data Tables**: Sortable, paginated tables with search functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **State Management**: Context API for efficient data flow
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive unit tests for reliability
- **Performance Optimized**: Memoization and lazy loading

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: React 18 (JavaScript)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- **Charts**: Recharts library for data visualization
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier configuration
- **Build Tool**: Create React App

### Architecture Decisions

I chose React with Context API for state management to keep the application lightweight while maintaining good separation of concerns. The component architecture follows a modular approach where each section is independently testable and reusable.

## 📈 Data & Calculations

### KPI Calculations
- **Total Revenue**: Sum of all sales transactions
- **Target Achievement**: Current month sales vs monthly target percentage
- **Revenue Growth**: Month-over-month growth using formula: `(Current - Previous) / Previous × 100`

### Data Processing
The application processes mock sales data including:
- 20 sales transactions across 3 months
- 9 different products across 4 categories
- 7 customers from various industries
- Monthly targets and performance tracking

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

I focused on creating a clean, professional interface inspired by modern dashboard design principles:
- **Minimalist Layout**: Clean sections with proper spacing
- **Color Psychology**: Green for success, red for decline, blue for information
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear typography and consistent spacing
- **Interactive Elements**: Smooth hover effects and transitions

## 📱 Responsive Design

The dashboard is fully responsive with:
- **Desktop (1200px+)**: Full layout with side-by-side charts and tables
- **Tablet (768-1199px)**: Stacked layout with maintained functionality
- **Mobile (320-767px)**: Single column layout with horizontal scrolling for tables

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

I implemented comprehensive testing covering:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions
- **Utility Tests**: Data calculation accuracy
- **Responsive Tests**: Cross-device compatibility

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```
